# DNA Classification Project

## Overview

This project focuses on the classification of DNA sequences into different classes using machine learning algorithms. The genetic information in DNA sequences is represented as strings of characters (A, T, G, C), and the task is to predict the functional class or other attributes associated with these sequences. The project explores various machine learning models and evaluates their performance to identify the best classifier for this task.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project, "DNA.csv," contains DNA sequences along with their corresponding class labels. Each DNA sequence is represented as a string of nucleotides, and the class labels indicate the functional or structural attributes associated with each sequence. The dataset is split into training and testing sets to evaluate the models' performance.

## Data Preprocessing

Before training the machine learning models, the DNA sequences undergo some preprocessing steps:

1. **Data Cleaning**: The dataset is checked for any missing values or anomalies that might affect the model's performance. Missing values are handled appropriately based on the nature of the dataset.

2. **Feature Extraction**: DNA sequences are represented as "k-mers" to convert the strings into numerical features. K-mers are subsequences of length k extracted from the DNA strings. For example, a k-mer of length 6 from the sequence "ATGCAT" would be "ATGCAT."

3. **Vectorization**: The k-mers are then converted into numerical features using techniques like one-hot encoding or count vectorization. These features are suitable inputs for machine learning algorithms.

## Models

The project employs several machine learning models to classify the DNA sequences. The following models are evaluated and compared:

1. **Naive Bayes**: A probabilistic classifier based on Bayes' theorem, suitable for multi-class classification tasks like this one.

2. **Random Forest**: An ensemble learning method that builds multiple decision trees and combines their predictions to improve accuracy.

3. **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**: A powerful classification algorithm that finds the optimal hyperplane to separate different classes.

4. **XGBoost**: An optimized gradient boosting library known for its speed and performance in machine learning competitions.

## Evaluation Metrics

To assess the models' performance, the following evaluation metrics are used:

- **Accuracy**: The proportion of correctly classified samples out of the total samples.

- **Precision**: The ability of the model to correctly identify positive samples among all predicted positive samples.

- **Recall**: The ability of the model to identify all positive samples among the actual positive samples.

- **F1-Score**: The harmonic mean of precision and recall, providing a balanced metric for classification performance.

The model with the highest F1-Score is chosen as the final model for this classification task.

## Results and Discussion

The results of each model's performance metrics are displayed in a comparative table in the "Results" section of the Jupyter Notebook. The model with the highest F1-Score is selected as the final model for deployment.

The performance of the final model is analyzed in detail, and insights are drawn regarding its strengths and limitations in handling the DNA classification task. Further steps for improvement are discussed, such as exploring advanced feature extraction techniques, hyperparameter tuning, or using deep learning models for more complex classification tasks.

## Usage

To reproduce the results of this project, follow the steps below:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using the command: `git clone https://github.com/your_username/dna-classification.git`

2. Install the required dependencies by running: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

3. Execute the Jupyter Notebook "DNA_Classification.ipynb" to train and evaluate the machine learning models on the DNA dataset.

4. After training, you can use the trained model to classify new DNA sequences by calling the "predict" method of the chosen model on the k-mer features of the new sequences.
